                        ELECTROTECHNICAL SCHOOL Mihailo Pupin was established by decision of the People's Committee of Novi Sad Municipality,
                        May 16, 1963. The need for the establishment of such a school institution arose from the development of the economy of Vojvodina
                        in the sixties, which required a greater number of personnel of the electrical profession than the one who had by that time been
                        educated at the technical school "Bosko Palkovljevic Pinky", a school for highly skilled workers, an industrial school with a
                        practical training and at the school of students in the economy "Svetozar Miletic".
